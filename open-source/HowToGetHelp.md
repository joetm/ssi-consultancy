## What is and is not supported

* All official sameAs Lite releases, with a version number are supported.
* Tagged released versions taken from Git are supported.
* Our support is 'best effort' i.e., we'll do the best we can, given our other commitments.
* Arbitrary versions taken from Git are **not** supported.

## How to ask for help 

* Please submit only one bug per report.
* State your operating system and version.
* State any non-standard UK set up on your machine e.g. which language edition of Windows; which regional settings you are using.
* State your sameAs Lite version which can be one of:
  - Version number.
  - Git tag name.
  - Git commit hash.
* Provide any error messages and exceptions that you see.
  - If providing exceptions then please provide these exactly as printed.
  - Please do not provide a simple textual summary like 'It threw an error'.
* If possible, upload configuration files that demonstrates the bug.
* Provide any other information you think will help.
* Clearly separate fact from speculation.
* Requests of the form 'I used sameAs Lite and am stuck!' are not helpful to either you or us and people may suspect that you are just a spammer or time waster.
* No bug is too trivial to report - small bugs may hide big bugs!

Please be patient! The sameAs Lite team consists of members in a number of organisations who work on a number of projects, and may be very busy. sameAs Lite's support relies on the goodwill of these members and organisations.
